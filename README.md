# predlagam.
predlagam. is the ultimate way to implement suggestions in your Discord server. If you have any problems, questions, or suggestions, don't hesitate to use the `>>feedback` command to let me know. Shout out to open source.

## ❯❯ Motivation
* I've never joined a server that had a good way for members to voice their opinions. From not having suggestions to disorganized single-channel spam, I've yet to see a good solution to the problem.
* In an attempt to fix this for my friends' servers, I created this bot. Given that this is an issue for thousands of Discord servers, I decided to clean up the code and make it public.

## ❯❯ Usage
* If you've decided to add the bot to your server, thank you!
* The bot features a simple `>>autoconfig` command which will set up all the required channels and permissions for you.
* To view all available commands, use `>>help`

## ❯❯ Future
* Allow users to configure prefix.
* Allow users to configure channel names (logs, votes, suggestions).
* Allow users to configure roles/permissions that can use logs/votes.
* Autoconfig settings (different names, overwrite, etc.)
* User blacklist.
* If you have any suggestions, please let me know! It's open source for a reason ‒ I love hearing other peoples' ideas.
