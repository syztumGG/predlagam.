# predlagam. [![Status](https://discordbots.org/api/widget/status/557063959606460458.svg)](https://discordbots.org/bot/557063959606460458)
predlagam. is the ultimate way to add suggestions to your server. If you have any problems, questions, or suggestions, don't hesitate to join the support server and ask. Shout out to open-source.

## ❯❯ Motivation
• I've never joined a server that had a good way for members to voice their opinions. From not having suggestions, to disorganized single-channel spam, to other Discord bots that don't give you the full feature set, I've seen it all.

• In an attempt to fix this for my friends' servers, I created this bot. Given that this is an issue for thousands of Discord servers, I decided to clean up the code, make it a public bot, and open source it, because :heart:.

## ❯❯ Usage
• If you've decided to add the bot to your server, thank you!

• The bot features a simple `>>autoconfig` command which will set up all the required channels and permissions for you.

• To view all available commands, use `>>help`.

## ❯❯ Future
• Allow users to configure prefix.

• Allow users to configure channel names (logs, votes, suggestions).

• Allow users to configure roles/permissions that can use logs/votes.

• Autoconfig settings (different names, overwrite, etc.)

• User blacklist.

• Filter help command based on available commands to the user.

• If you have any suggestions, please let me know! It's open source for a reason ‒ I love hearing other peoples' ideas.
