# predlagam.
predlagam. is the ultimate way to add suggestions to your server. After inviting, use `>>help` to view available commands. If you have any problems, questions, or suggestions, don't hesitate to join the support server and ask. Shout out to open-source.

## ❯❯ Motivation
• I've never joined a server that had a good way for members to voice their opinions. From not having suggestions, to disorganized single-channel spam, to other Discord bots that don't give you the full feature set, I've seen it all.

• In an attempt to fix this for my friends' servers, I created this bot. Given that this is an issue for thousands of Discord servers, I decided to clean up the code, make it a public bot, and open source it just for fun.
